It's possible to indulge (almost) your every fantasy, interest or whim at sun-drenched resorts around the globe. No longer resting on their tropical locales alone, luxury resorts are devising ever more creative "signature experiences" designed to give them an edge over their competitors and keep guests entertained and inspired.

The Asia resort architect extraordinaire Bill Bensley says lying on a beach or by the pool is no longer enough for today's travellers, who are searching for travel with meaning and purpose.

Bensley first started designing resorts in 1984 when resorts were considered a big deal if they had a pool, a buffet and, wait for it, a business centre.</p>
